This project analyzes a dataset of 1,000 pharmaceutical drugs to examine the relationships between drug types, dosage levels, treatment duration, patient improvement scores, and reported side effects. The objective is to generate data-driven insights that support better clinical decision-making,, improve patient outcomes, and highlight potential safety concerns associated with drug usage. Analytical techniques including descriptive statistics, pivot analysis and regression analysis were applied, with results visualized using Power BI dashboards for clarity and accessibility.
## RESEARCH-QUESTIONS
1. To what extent does treatment duration influence patient improvement scores?
2. How does drug dosage affect patient improvement across different medical conditions?
3. Does patient age influence improvement outcomes across different treatments?
4. Which combination of drug type and dosage yields the highest average improvement score?
## Methodology

The analysis followed these key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

   * Standardizing drug names and categories
   * Ensuring numerical variables were correctly formatted

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Descriptive statistics
   * Frequency and distribution analysis
   * Initial visual exploration of key variables

3. **Statistical Analysis**

   * Regression analysis to assess relationships between dosage, treatment duration, and improvement scores
   * pivot analysis to compare patient outcomes across different drugs or categories

4. **Visualization and Reporting**

   * Power BI dashboards
   * Charts and tables to highlight key insights
   * Executive summaries for high-level interpretation
